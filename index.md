Probably no global crisis in history has been so closely captured by and with data. We have been able to follow the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus rise almost in real time in dashboards and sophisticated data visualisations. Politicians, scientists and citizens have been able to consult these data to learn more about the spread and extent of the pandemic and base their decisions on this information. 

However, we think that the available data may be even more useful than they have already proved to be! We believe that by diving deep into the available data and by tapping the potential of additional data sources, we can not only learn about the spread of the crisis, but also learn about ways of how to successfully tackle its consequences.  

One way to do this is with the Data Based Positive Deviance approach.

## Data-Driven Approach
Oftentimes the best and most suitable responses towards pressing issues such as the Corona-Crisis may already be out there. They , having been discovered by innovative individuals or groups that face similar circumstances as the rest but, however, that manage to fare better than their peers due to the creative solutions they have developed. The people, groups, organisations who come up with these solutions are called positive deviants. 

In the context of the Corona-Crisis positive deviants may be communities that successfully communicate in a particular way, show lower infection or mortality rates than others etc. even though they have similar amounts of resources then comparable entities.

Whereas the traditional positive deviance approach has been proven successful in the context of development cooperation, it has not been adopted at a large scale - since it is very time and resource intensive. However, the widespread availability of Big Data can potentially revolutionise this approach and make it more easily implementable. We strongly believe that the power of data can guide us towards positive deviants that fare better than others due to their unique solutions and help us learn from their successful way of doing things. We also believe that by implementing their unique solutions in other places, we can contribute to tackle and solve this crisis together!


## Our Hackathon Experience
This website was developed within 48 hours as part of the #wirvsvirus hackathon.  During the Hackathon, tThe German Federal Government challenged over 40.000XX participants to jointly develop solutions to mitigate the consequences of the corona crisis. During those 48 hours, we worked with an enthusiastic interdisciplinary group of data analysts, psychologists, political scientists, and development cooperation professionals. With enthusiasm, social and data scientists worked in several teams. In 48 hours, wWe wantcreated a working website with the aim to encouragecontent for the public and the research community to explore how data powered engage in Positive Deviance (PD) analysis can help to tackle societal challenges in the corona crisis. By making the data insightful, and intuitive, and actionable, we hope that future analysts will continue to work on these projects. 


## Further Questions of Interest
The corona crisis has fundamentally changed the economic, social and political circumstances we live in. At this moment, we as a society are taking action to reduce the spread of the corona virus and reduce its harm for possibly millions of people. In the upcoming months, we will face the challenge to maintain a functioning society  - despite a rivalling virus. The challenges posed by Covid 19 will not be gone within a couple of weeks. We are in for the long run.

Considering this long-term perspective, we see a need to track positive deviants within economic, social and political contexts. Which family businesses have successfully switched to the food delivery sector? Which schools managed to set up an e-learning platform that enabled children to keep up their learning progress while staying at home? Which municipalities got a grip on the piling up administrative work that used to be done only on paper?


## We can also integrate HTML plots
This random plot was generated with Bokeh for Python and the output `.html` file can easily be included:
{% include randomplot.html %}

This way, we can ask the other teams to produce independent `.html` files of their results so that in the end we can embedd them here super quick.
